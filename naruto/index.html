                <p>What does the Akatsuki represent?
                    The Akatsuki: Why We Fight
                    The Akatsuki is the most famous evil organization in all anime. Its members are comprised of rebels, outcasts, and outlaws. Each member has their own reasons for wreaking havoc on the world of Naruto, and those reasons are much the same as the reasons people go to war in real life.They begin to recruit powerful and dangerous ninja into their ranks and solidify themselves as a powerhouse organization. The main objective of Akatsuki has always been to collect the tailed-beasts, but before they begin that life-long mission, they start off by becoming mercenaries.</p>

                <h3>Nagato Uzumaki</h3>
                <p>Nowhere does it state the descendant has to be a direct descendant, the Uzumaki Clan are cousins of the Senju clan and while they are related they are seperate clans. Naruto, Nagato and Karin are all from the Uzumaki clan which means they share a common ancestor with the Senju i.e. Ashura.</div>

                <h3>Konan</h3>
                <p>Konan is an S-rank kunoichi and her skills were held in high regard by her partner, Pain. She has an amazing natural talent for origami. As a child, after training with Jiraiya, she was able to form paper weapons infused with her chakra..After Jiraiya trained them they were on their own and on one certain episode it is shown that Konan is treating Yahiko and as they come closer they lean in for a kiss. This can imply that Konan had crush or romantic feeling for Yahiko and not Nagato as he was just a friend. Even Yahiko had romantic feelings for Konan.</p>
